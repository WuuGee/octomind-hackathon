# 🐙 OctoMind: Digital Carbon Twin for Personal Sustainability

OctoMind is an **AI-powered hackathon project** that helps people understand the real impact of their daily lifestyle choices on both the **planet** and their **personal health**.  
By gamifying sustainability with fun octopus-themed challenges, OctoMind makes eco-friendly living **engaging, personalized, and actionable**.

## 🔑 Problem
Most people don’t realize how everyday actions—like eating meat, driving, or using air conditioning—impact both the **environment** (carbon emissions) and their **health**.  
Existing tools are static, boring, and not personal. Health trackers ignore sustainability, and carbon calculators ignore health.

## 💡 Solution
OctoMind combines **AI + Sustainability + Health + Gamification**:  
- **AI Lifestyle Analyzer**: Translates daily activities into carbon + health impacts.  
- **Conversational Coach**: Chatbot mentor that gives fun, actionable tips.  
- **Tentacle Dashboard**: Visual octopus with green tentacles showing progress.  
- **Gamified Quests**: Daily eco-health challenges to build sustainable habits.

## 🎯 MVP Goals (Hackathon Phase 1)
- ✅ Simple input: User enters an activity (e.g., “ate beef”, “drove 5 km”).  
- ✅ System returns both carbon footprint + health impact.  
- ✅ Basic octopus-themed dashboard to visualize results.  
- ✅ Hosted landing page with Firebase backend & Firestore DB.
